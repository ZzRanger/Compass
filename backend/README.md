## Instructions

Edit the `.env` file to set the port (default 8080) and the postgres database url. Replace `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` with a database user and do not change anything else if you would like a database to be created for you. Note that the default postgres user has no password and you must give it one if you want to use it here.

Enter the command `cargo run` and on your browser, go to `localhost:8080` to view the hello world page.
